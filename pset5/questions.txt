0.  TODO bmp support 256 color
         jpeg support 16.7 million colors
         gif supports 256 colors
1.  TODO gif supports animation
2.  TODO in lossless compression all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed but thats not in 
         the case of lossy compression
3.  TODO jpeg
4.  TODO The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
         been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters 
         to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
5.  TODO Write NUL bytes (or random characters) to every address on the disk.
6.  TODO A bunch of typedefs and macros for making integer variables of custom sizes.
7.  TODO You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good for things like bitmap headers.
8.  TODO BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
         DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
         LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
         WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes  
9.  TODO Hex:    0x424d
10. TODO bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file
         biSize is the number of bytes in the info header 
11. TODO If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. TODO biBitCount
13. TODO due to some error it cant create the file
14. TODO Because it specifies how many elements you want to read
15. TODO The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12,which is a multiple of 4.
16. TODO It moves to a specific location in a file.
17. TODO gives the current location of file pointer
18. TODO Milo Banana dun it
